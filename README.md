# Hi 👋 My name is  Andrey Shamshaev

## Java developer

I’ve been learning to code for one year after switching careers from automobile production. Programming was my second passion in my youth, and I decided that I did not want to miss the opportunity to realize myself in this direction as well. I found a passion for backend development because I’d like the idea to make a business logic that makes this business better, more efficient, and more profitable.

- 📍	I'm currently based in Naberezhnye Chelny, Russia
- 🎓 I graduated from Kazan Technical University named after A. N. Tupolev
- 📚 I'm learning the Spring Framework and more
